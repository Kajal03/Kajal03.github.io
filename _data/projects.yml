  name: University of Delhi Scorecard Fetcher
  github: Kajal03/University-of-Delhi-Scorecard-Mailer
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    A web-scraping system that emails the candidate his/her scorecard upon the declaration of result
    The system is capable of fetching scorecards of different colleges and courses throughout Delhi University
    Tesseract-OCR​ is employed to bypass captcha on University’s website

  name: Driver Drowsiness Detection System
  github: Kajal03/Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    A computer vision system that detects driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream
    o An alarm is triggered if the driver appears to be drowsy depending upon the driver failing a certain
    threshold score
    o The system can also be deployed to prevent/detect fatigue-related accidents

  name: AI Image Captioning Bot
  github: Kajal03/AI-Image-Captioning-Bot
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    A Deep Learning model for Image Captioning, wherein the bot takes an image from the user and generates
    captions describing it
    o For easy access, the system is deployed as a Flask Web Application
    o The model uses transfer learning to extract features from an image which are further used by LSTM layers
    to generate captions
